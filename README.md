## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The goal was to build an end-to-end cloud data warehousing solution:
- Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations using **Apache Hop**
- Cloud-based data modeling and loading into **Oracle Cloud**
- Creating a connected live dashboard in **Tableau** for real-time insights

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Apache Hop** â€“ ETL pipeline development
- **Oracle Cloud** â€“ Cloud data warehousing and SQL processing
- **Tableau** â€“ Data visualization and dashboarding
- **SQL** â€“ Dimensional modeling and querying
- **Jupyter/Docs** â€“ Report documentation

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Activities

### ðŸ”„ ETL & Data Modeling
- Built dimensional models with **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**
- Created **fact tables** using transactional and dimension data
- Developed pipelines to load data into Oracle Cloud using loaders

### ðŸ§ª Oracle Cloud & SQL
- Loaded and validated data using `SELECT * FROM` queries
- Used lookup strategies to avoid heavy constraints like foreign keys
- Populated fact and dimension tables (Product, Customer, Date, etc.)

### ðŸ“ˆ Tableau Visualization
- Connected Tableau to Oracle Cloud via secure live connection
- Created dashboards using:
  - Bar charts, line graphs, KPI summaries
  - Dynamic filters, tooltips, calculated fields
- Explored forecast models using additive seasonality

## âœ… Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with designing a scalable data warehousing architecture, loading data into cloud systems, and transforming raw data into meaningful visuals using Tableau. The ability to model business logic through ETL pipelines, maintain historical accuracy via SCD, and present data visually sets a strong foundation for analytics and BI roles.
